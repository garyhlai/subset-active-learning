## Evaluation Notebook: `test.ipynb`

- Use the notebook `test.ipynb` to do model evaluation and reproduce the figures/plots in the Notion page.
- Use this notebook as an anchor to find the paths of the checkpoints.

## Wandb Runs

- The notion page includes links to the wandb runs, each of which contains the git hash to the commit used for the training run.

### Subset Sampling

- Classifier checkpoint used for sampling: `/results/checkpoints/optimal_subset_classifier_19500`

### TODO

- [ ] decide on a way to share checkpoints (S3?)
